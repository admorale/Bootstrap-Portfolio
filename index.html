                <p>What a ride! It’s been 23 years since I started (formally) in the technology business. Although I’ve been around computers since I was a small kid, I was decided to become a civil engineer, but destiny had a different plan and I started working at IBM as a Networking Specialist. That was back in 1995. During these 23 years, I have had to adapt my career and my skills to the market, moving form Networking to Linux Consulting then to DataBase administration and now back to Networking and Mobility services.</p>
                <p>This rollercoaster took me from Venezuela to Mexico, four years ago, when Cisco relocated me to work with Service Provider accounts in this country.</p>
                <p>Now I'm facing what could be the next step in my career. The networking industry is moving towards automation and programmability, that's why is now necessary to have programming and web development skills. I feel that becoming a full stack developer is the right path in the evolution of the skills required for the current technology market. So many ideas on how I could use these new development skills to solve everyday problems we face in the Service Provider world.</p>
